# FAQ

Q: So this is a set about... anarchism? Anarchists? Why would you make this? Is it some sort of propaganda?
A: It's a set full to the brim with anarchists and their stories. The worldbuilding is done in earnest by a whole lot of wonderful people, and the world being built is the real one. I made a Magic set out of it because it brings me joy to make art at the intersection of things I love. If people want to engage about the political themes, that's cool too, but I'm not here to argue, I'm here to share stories and play Magic.

Q: Uh, it's all anarchists. What about everything else in the world? Isn't the limited format going to be anarchists fighting... anarchists? Where are the bad guys?
A: You know the bad guys. They are states and corporations, cops and stockbrokers, misogynists and neonazis. They are in conflict with each other in some ways, but they share a lot of interests, and as a whole we might call them empire.
Most sets try to provide a full tour of the setting. But you know this setting. I want to show you the anarchists - the folks trying to find ways to take care of each other and fight back against overwhelming odds - because you might not recognize them or their tactics from your day to day life. I don't need to give you the same tour of the bad guys. Read the news from the past week, any week. You know them all too well.
And this is Magic. We're used to seeing the same faction - or even two copies of the same character - on opposite sides of the battlefield. Designing and playing with cards for the "bad guys" does not bring me joy, so I won't.

Q: Hmm, there's a lot of Midjourney art on the cards. Do you have something to say about AI art?
A: The art on a Magic card has a few important jobs. It makes the card look like a Magic card. It makes the cards uniquely identifiable at a glance, once you know them. And it helps deliver the narrative of the card in ways the name and flavor text don't have room to. Given my (lack of) budget and (lack of) artistic talent, Midjourney is the tool I use because I don't actually need art, I need graphics. Also sometimes I find good enough art on the internet and just download and use that. Obviously real commissioned art would be better.

Q: What the heck are those mythic incarnations? Those don't look like anarchists at all!
A: Ok, so I said I wasn't going to make cards for the forces the anarchists are fighting against, I lied. Fourteen of the mythic rares in the set are personifications of these systemic forces. The abstraction holds them at a conformable distance where I feel good engaging with them in the game. Check the incarnations out, they're pretty cool.

Q: I don't like something about a card's effect/art/name/flavor text. Do you want to hear it?
A: Yes I want to hear it!! Even if I have my own opinions or attachments to the cards, it's great to know what other people think. Balance is a continuous process. And I also want to continually be going through and replacing my worst pieces of art and ft, to keep raising the standard for the set over all.

# Mechanics of Against Power

Battles: The set introduces two simple types of battles, Missions and Barricades. Missions are battles you attack that have ETB and LTB effects. They appear more at lower rarities and hold roles that would typically be held by sorceries. Barricades are battles you defend that provide some kind of continuous benefit, and mostly appear at uncommon and up. Because of the prevalence of battles (and the setting), there are no planeswalkers in this set.

Skillshare: An action word that appears on creatures, Skillshare gives another target creature you control the skillsharing creature's other abilities until end of turn. It works similarly to Back-up, but with more flexibility in how it can be activated or triggered.

Vouch: Appearing in the cost of abilities or as an additional cost for spells, you can Vouch by tapping an untapped creature you control or by paying 2 generic mana. Kind of like if Convoke met Forage.

Rouse: Rouse lets you exile a card from your graveyard and pay its Rouse cost to cast a copy of it. On permanents, this plays like Embalm without the mummy part. On non-permanents, this is almost exactly Flashback.

Cloak: A returning keyword from Murders at Karlov Manor, Cloak is like Manifest, but with Ward 2. Or like Disguise, but for another card. You already know this one.
